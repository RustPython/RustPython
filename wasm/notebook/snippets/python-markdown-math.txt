## RustPython Notebook with Markdown and Math

Look! I can write markdown in the notebook. It's even syntax-highlighted correctly!

1. i can make a list
1. i can haz many lines and numbers
1. I can paste emojis  🐍 😱 🤘

In the notebook, you can write markdown, math and python. use %% then: 
- md for markdown
- py for python
- math for large, centered math blocks
- math-inline for an inline math block


I **can** bold things and _italicize_ them. You got the gist, this is standard
markdown syntax that you can [google](google.com).

## Math

Supported TeX functions is [here](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html). For example: 

%%math 

\tau(u_f)*l_f

 \newline

H(t) \xrightarrow{write} \Big[A(t+1),\ H(t+1)\Big]

\newline 


\newline

% \f is defined as #1f(#2) using the macro
\f\relax{x} = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
    \f\hat\xi,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
    \,d\xi

\newline
\begin{Bmatrix}
   a & b \\
   c & d
\end{Bmatrix}

\dbinom{n}{k}

\sqrt[3]{x}


%%py

print("RustPython called back and said people need to have")

# You can run regular python code here.
# Here is a random number generator.
import random 
rnd = random.randint(1,5)

print("nice " * rnd + "things.")
