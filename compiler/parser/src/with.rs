//! Intermediate types for `with` statement cover grammar.
//!
//! When we start parsing a `with` statement, we don't initially know
//! whether we're looking at a tuple or a Python 3.9+ parenthesized
//! collection of contexts:
//!
//! ```python
//! with (a, b, c) as t:  # tuple
//! with (a, b, c):  # withitems
//! ```
//!
//! Since LALRPOP requires us to commit to an output type before we
//! have enough information to decide, we build a cover grammar that's
//! convertible either way.  This module contains the necessary
//! intermediate data types.
