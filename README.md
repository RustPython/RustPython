A Python-3 (CPython >= 3.5.0) Interpreter written in Rust :snake: :scream:
:metal:.

## Usage

#### Check out our [online demo](https://rustpython.github.io/demo/) running on WebAssembly.

RustPython requires Rust latest stable version (e.g 1.43.0 at May 24th 2020). 
To check Rust version: `rustc --version` If you wish to update,
`rustup update stable`.

To test RustPython, do the following:

    $ git clone https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython
    $ cd RustPython
    # if you're on windows:
    $ powershell scripts\symlinks-to-hardlinks.ps1
    $ cargo run demo.py
    Hello, RustPython!

Or use the interactive shell:

    $ cargo run
    Welcome to rustpython
    >>>>> 2+2
    4

You can also install and run RustPython with the following:

    $ cargo install rustpython
    $ rustpython
    Welcome to the magnificent Rust Python interpreter
    >>>>>

Or through the `conda` package manager:

    $ conda install rustpython -c conda-forge
    $ rustpython


### WASI

You can compile RustPython to a standalone WebAssembly WASI module so it can run anywhere.

```shell
$ wapm install rustpython
$ wapm run rustpython
>>>>> 2+2
4
```

#### Building the WASI file

You can build the WebAssembly WASI file with:

```
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasi --features="freeze-stdlib"
```

> Note: we use the `freeze-stdlib` to include the standard library inside the binary.


## Embedding RustPython into your Rust Applications

Interested in exposing Python scripting in an application written in Rust,
perhaps to allow quickly tweaking logic where Rust's compile times would be inhibitive?
Then `examples/hello_embed.rs` and `examples/mini_repl.rs` may be of some assistance.

## Disclaimer

RustPython is in a development phase and should not be used in production or a
fault intolerant setting.

Our current build supports only a subset of Python syntax.

Contribution is also more than welcome! See our contribution section for more
information on this.

## Conference videos

Checkout those talks on conferences:

- [FOSDEM 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJDY9ASuiLc)
- [EuroPython 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMmio0JHy_Y)

## Use cases

Allthough rustpython is a very young project, it is already used in the wild:

- [pyckitup](https://github.com/pickitup247/pyckitup): a game engine written in
  rust.
- [codingworkshops.org](https://github.com/chicode/codingworkshops): a site
  where you can learn how to code.

## Goals

- Full Python-3 environment entirely in Rust (not CPython bindings)
- A clean implementation without compatibility hacks

## Documentation

Currently along with other areas of the project, documentation is still in an
early phase.

You can read the [online documentation](https://docs.rs/rustpython-vm) for the
latest release.

You can also generate documentation locally by running:

```shell
$ cargo doc # Including documentation for all dependencies
$ cargo doc --no-deps --all # Excluding all dependencies
```

Documentation HTML files can then be found in the `target/doc` directory.

## Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome, and in many cases we are happy to guide
contributors through PRs or on gitter. Please refer to the
[development guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) as well for tips on developments.

With that in mind, please note this project is maintained by volunteers, some of
the best ways to get started are below:

Most tasks are listed in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/issues). Check issues
labeled with `good first issue` if you wish to start coding.

To enhance CPython compatibility, try to increase unittest coverage by checking this article: [How to contribute to RustPython by CPython unittest](https://rustpython.github.io/guideline/2020/04/04/how-to-contribute-by-cpython-unittest.html)

Another approach is to checkout the source code: builtin functions and object
methods are often the simplest and easiest way to contribute.

You can also simply run `./whats_left.sh` to assist in finding any unimplemented
method.

## Using a different standard library

As of now the standard library is under construction. You can change a standard
library by setting the RUSTPYTHONPATH environment variable.

To do this, follow this method:

```shell
$ export RUSTPYTHONPATH=./Lib  # this is same as the default value
$ cargo run -- -c 'import xdrlib'
```

You can play around with other standard libraries for python. For example, the
[ouroboros library](https://github.com/pybee/ouroboros) or CPython Lib.
