A Python-3 (CPython >= 3.9.0) Interpreter written in Rust :snake: :scream:
:metal:.

## Usage

#### Check out our [online demo](https://rustpython.github.io/demo/) running on WebAssembly.

RustPython requires Rust latest stable version (e.g 1.43.0 at May 24th 2020). 
To check Rust version: `rustc --version` If you wish to update,
`rustup update stable`.

To build RustPython locally, do the following:

    $ git clone https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython
    $ cd RustPython
      # --release is needed (at least on windows) to prevent stack overflow
    $ cargo run --release demo.py
    Hello, RustPython!

Or use the interactive shell:

    $ cargo run --release
    Welcome to rustpython
    >>>>> 2+2
    4
    
NOTE: For windows users, please set `RUSTPYTHONPATH` environment variable as `Lib` path in project directory.
(e.g. When RustPython directory is `C:\RustPython`, set `RUSTPYTHONPATH` as `C:\RustPython\Lib`)

You can also install and run RustPython with the following:

    $ cargo install --git https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython
    $ rustpython
    Welcome to the magnificent Rust Python interpreter
    >>>>>

(The `rustpython-*` crates are currently yanked from crates.io due to being out
of date and not building on newer rust versions; we hope to release a new
version Soonâ„¢)

If you'd like to make https requests, you can enable the `ssl` feature, which
also lets you install the `pip` package manager. Note that on Windows, you may
need to install OpenSSL, or you can enable the `ssl-vendor` feature instead,
which compiles OpenSSL for you but requires a C compiler, perl, and `make`.

Once you've installed rustpython with SSL support, you can install pip by
running:

    $ rustpython --install-pip

You can also install RustPython through the `conda` package manager, though
this isn't officially supported and may be out of date:

    $ conda install rustpython -c conda-forge
    $ rustpython


### WASI

You can compile RustPython to a standalone WebAssembly WASI module so it can run anywhere.

```shell
$ wapm install rustpython
$ wapm run rustpython
>>>>> 2+2
4
```

#### Building the WASI file

You can build the WebAssembly WASI file with:

```
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasi --features="freeze-stdlib"
```

> Note: we use the `freeze-stdlib` to include the standard library inside the binary. You also have to run once `rustup target add wasm32-wasi`.

### JIT (Just in time) compiler

RustPython has an **very** experimental JIT compiler that compile python functions into native code. 

#### Building

By default the JIT compiler isn't enabled, it's enabled with the `jit` cargo feature.

    $ cargo run --features jit
    
This requires autoconf, automake, libtool, and clang to be installed.

#### Using 

To compile a function, call `__jit__()` on it.

```python
def foo():
    a = 5
    return 10 + a

foo.__jit__()  # this will compile foo to native code and subsequent calls will execute that native code
assert foo() == 15
```

## Embedding RustPython into your Rust Applications

Interested in exposing Python scripting in an application written in Rust,
perhaps to allow quickly tweaking logic where Rust's compile times would be inhibitive?
Then `examples/hello_embed.rs` and `examples/mini_repl.rs` may be of some assistance.

## Disclaimer

RustPython is in development, and while the interpreter certainly can be used
in interesting use cases like running Python in WASM and embedding into a Rust
project, do note that RustPython is not totally production-ready.

Contribution is more than welcome! See our contribution section for more
information on this.

## Conference videos

Checkout those talks on conferences:

- [FOSDEM 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJDY9ASuiLc)
- [EuroPython 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMmio0JHy_Y)

## Use cases

Although RustPython is a fairly young project, a few people have used it to
make cool projects:

- [pyckitup](https://github.com/pickitup247/pyckitup): a game engine written in
  rust.
- [Robot Rumble](https://github.com/robot-rumble/logic/): an arena-based AI competition platform

## Goals

- Full Python-3 environment entirely in Rust (not CPython bindings)
- A clean implementation without compatibility hacks

## Documentation

Currently along with other areas of the project, documentation is still in an
early phase.

You can read the [online documentation](https://docs.rs/rustpython-vm) for the
latest release, or the [user guide](https://rustpython.github.io/docs/).

You can also generate documentation locally by running:

```shell
$ cargo doc # Including documentation for all dependencies
$ cargo doc --no-deps --all # Excluding all dependencies
```

Documentation HTML files can then be found in the `target/doc` directory.

## Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome, and in many cases we are happy to guide
contributors through PRs or on gitter. Please refer to the
[development guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) as well for tips on developments.

With that in mind, please note this project is maintained by volunteers, some of
the best ways to get started are below:

Most tasks are listed in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/issues). Check issues
labeled with [good first issue](https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/issues?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+) if you wish to start coding.

To enhance CPython compatibility, try to increase unittest coverage by checking this article: [How to contribute to RustPython by CPython unittest](https://rustpython.github.io/guideline/2020/04/04/how-to-contribute-by-cpython-unittest.html)

Another approach is to checkout the source code: builtin functions and object
methods are often the simplest and easiest way to contribute.

You can also simply run `./whats_left.sh` to assist in finding any unimplemented
method.
