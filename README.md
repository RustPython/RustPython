# RustPython

A Python-3 (CPython >= 3.5.0) Interpreter written in Rust :snake: :scream:
:metal:.

## Usage

#### Check out our [online demo](https://rustpython.github.io/demo/) running on WebAssembly.

To test RustPython, do the following:

    $ git clone https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython
    $ cd RustPython
    $ cargo run demo.py
    Hello, RustPython!

Or use the interactive shell:

    $ cargo run
    Welcome to rustpython
    >>>>> 2+2

## Disclaimer

RustPython is in a development phase and should not be used in production or a
fault intolerant setting.

Our current build supports only a subset of Python syntax.

Contribution is also more than welcome! See our contribution section for more
information on this.

## Conference videos

Checkout those talks on conferences:

- [FOSDEM 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJDY9ASuiLc)
- [EuroPython 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMmio0JHy_Y)

## Use cases

Allthough rustpython is a very young project, it is already used in the wild:

- [pyckitup](https://github.com/pickitup247/pyckitup): a game engine written in
  rust.
- [codingworkshops.org](https://github.com/chicode/codingworkshops): a site
  where you can learn how to code.

## Goals

- Full Python-3 environment entirely in Rust (not CPython bindings)
- A clean implementation without compatibility hacks

## Documentation

Currently along with other areas of the project, documentation is still in an
early phase.

You can read the [online documentation](https://docs.rs/rustpython-vm) for the
latest release.

You can also generate documentation locally by running:

```shell
$ cargo doc # Including documentation for all dependencies
$ cargo doc --no-deps --all # Excluding all dependencies
```

Documentation HTML files can then be found in the `target/doc` directory.

## Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome, and in many cases we are happy to guide
contributors through PRs or on gitter. Please refer to the
[development guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) as well for tips on developments.

With that in mind, please note this project is maintained by volunteers, some of
the best ways to get started are below:

Most tasks are listed in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/issues). Check issues
labeled with `good first issue` if you wish to start coding.

Another approach is to checkout the source code: builtin functions and object
methods are often the simplest and easiest way to contribute.

You can also simply run `./whats_left.sh` to assist in finding any unimplemented
method.

## Using a standard library

As of now the standard library is under construction. You can use a standard
library by setting the RUSTPYTHONPATH environment variable.

To do this, follow this method:

```shell
$ export RUSTPYTHONPATH=~/GIT/RustPython/Lib
$ cargo run -- -c 'import xdrlib'
```

You can play around with other standard libraries for python. For example, the
[ouroboros library](https://github.com/pybee/ouroboros).
